# Password Generator
## Description

The motive of this project was to create a strong password generator for the user, using Javascript. The program generates a random password that is between a certain number of characters, and allows the user to choose what type of characters they want included in their password. The program then displays the generated password on the screen for the user to use. This program will not allow the user to generate a password that contains any character that was not chosen in the prompted answers. This project solves the need to come up with a unique and strong password. Throughout making this project, I learned a lot more about Javascript, and definitely feel more confident in understanding the functions to use.

##Usage

This project contains a 'Generate Password' button. Click the button, and then you will be prompeted to answer how long you would like your password to be. Once you answer a number that is between the set criteria (8-128), then you will be asked to confirm the different characters you want to be included in your random password.
